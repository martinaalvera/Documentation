Vault initialization
--------------------

The Vault initialization can not be automated. To initialize it and get your root token for the initial configuration 


#. Login on the VM hosting Vault:

   ::

     ssh root@<vault_vm_ip_address>


#. Initialize vault

   ::

     # docker exec -it vault vault operator init
     Unseal Key 1: p7YF7vyLRrfeilwlD/QusQ+UESJiGrhn1TwCsBAa7fKV
     Unseal Key 2: OHoyPApMFuQTz9B20bmpJjzLgkCi2ELr+zKFdvKq8lmL
     Unseal Key 3: xDRcbkOsYL9uswFzCdFqpxudgvZFVfAwFCkigYMMMCHt
     Unseal Key 4: LJ0hHW5dsmbuFAnL+W/4NMtZUbuNkILFWXxL3zTYblzQ
     Unseal Key 5: Z1OvJ7RvT+pUVtqB93RAQ8q1s8l04clGVFn+oi22x4rZ
     
     Initial Root Token: s.YxsTl9H3f1qgAqH3cj4JAXR8
     
     Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
     distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
     restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
     before it can start servicing requests.
     
     Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 3 key to
     reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!
     
     It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
     existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.


#. Every initialized Vault server starts in the `sealed state <https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/deploy#sealunseal>`_. Unsealing has to happen every time Vault starts. It can be done via the API and via the command line. To unseal the Vault, you must have the threshold number of unseal keys. In the output above, notice that the "key threshold" is 3. This means that to unseal the Vault, you need 3 of the 5 keys that were generated.

   ::

     # docker exec -it vault vault operator unseal p7YF7vyLRrfeilwlD/QusQ+UESJiGrhn1TwCsBAa7fKV

#. Finally, authenticate as the initial root token (it was included in the output with the unseal keys):

   ::

     # docker exec -it vault vault login s.YxsTl9H3f1qgAqH3cj4JAXR8
     Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
     is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
     again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.
