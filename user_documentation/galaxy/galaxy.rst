Launch Galaxy 
==========

The Laniakea dashboard tiles allow user to deploy a standard `Galaxy production environment <https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/production.html>`_ through two methods: |galaxy_vm| and |galaxy_latest|.

.. seealso::

   To login to the Laniakea dashboard visit the section: :doc:`/user_documentation//authentication/authentication`.

|galaxy_vm|

The |galaxy_vm| instantiate a CentOS 7 Virtual Machine with Galaxy, all its companion software and the set of tools that come with the selected flavour. Once deployed each Galaxy instance can be further customized with additional tools and reference data.

**This version is usually quite reliable and work well for most users.**

|galaxy_latest|

The |galaxy_latest| allows to setup and launch a virtual machine configured with the Operative System CentOS 7 and the auxiliary applications needed to support a Galaxy production environment such as PostgreSQL, Nginx, uWSGI and Proftpd and to deploy the Galaxy platform itself and the tools that come with the selected flavour.

This version is recommended for those users which want to be sure to have the latest available version of each tool.

.. Warning::

   In fact, each tool is downloaded from the repositories and configured on the fly. Depending on the number of the tools to be installed the deploument process may take time a variable amount of time.

Provide a description for your instance using the ``Instance description`` field, which will identfy your Galaxy in the **Deployments page**, once your request is submitted.

Two panels allows to configure the virtual hardware and the Galaxy instance respectively.

Virtual hardware configuration
******************************

#. Select your instance flavour (virtual CPUs and the memory size). More information on available virtual hardware presets can be found here: :doc:`virtual_hdw_presets`.

#. Copy & Paste your SSH key, to login in the Galaxy instance or configure it in the :doc:`/user_documentation//ssh_keys/ssh_keys` page

#. Laniakea provides the possibility to encrypt the storage volume associated with the virtual machine on-demand, to protect user data.

   To enable storage encryption set the switch to **ON** .

   .. Warning::

      Only the external volume where Galaxy data are stored is encrypted, not the Virtual Machine root disk.

   The storage will be encrypted with a strong alphanumerical passphrase. More information on this topic can be found here:

   - :doc:`/user_documentation/encryption/manage_encrypted_instance`
   - :doc:`/admin_documentation/encryption/encryption`

#. Finally, it is possible to select the user storage volume size.

Galaxy configuration
********************

#. Select the Galaxy version, the instance administrator e-mail and the Galaxy brand tag (the top-left name in the Galaxy home page).

#. Provide a valid e-mail address as Galaxy administrator credential.

   .. note::

      A notification mail will be sent to this e-mail address once the deployment is done.

#. Select the Galaxy flavour among those available (see section :doc:`galaxy_flavours`).

#. Select Galaxy reference dataset. The default should be the best choice for most users (see section :doc:`galaxy_refdata`).

#. Finally, ``SUBMIT`` your request.

Galaxy access
-------------

Once your Galaxy instance a confirmation e-mail is sent, to the Laniakea user and to the galaxy administrator email, if different, with the URL of Galaxy and user credentials.

.. Warning::

   If you don't receive the e-mail:

   #. Check you SPAM mail directory

   #. Chek mail address spelling

   #. Wait 15 minutes more.

The instance information are also available in the **Deployments** page of the dashboard:

::

  User: administrator e-mail

  Password: galaxy_admin_password

  API key: ADMIN_API_KEY

.. Warning::

   Change the Galaxy password and API key as soon as possible!
