Galaxy production environment
=============================
|project_name| allows to setup and launch a virtual machine (VM) configured with the Operative System (CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 16.04) and the auxiliary applications needed to support a Galaxy production environment such as PostgreSQL, Nginx, uWSGI and Proftpd and to deploy the Galaxy platform itself. A common set of Reference data is available through a CernVM-FS volume. Once deployed each Galaxy instance can be further customized with tools and reference data.

The Galaxy production environment is deployed according to Galaxy official documentation: https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/production.html.

OS support
----------
CentOS 7 is our default distribution, Given its adherence to Standards and the length of official support (CentOS-7 updates until June 30, 2024, https://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General#head-fe8a0be91ee3e7dea812e8694491e1dde5b75e6d). CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 16.04 are both supported.

.. Warning::

   Selinux is by default disabled on CentOS.

PostgresSQL
-----------

PostgreSQL packages coming from PostgreSQL official repository are installed:

.. note::

   Current installed PostgreSQL is: ``PostgreSQL 9.6``

==============  ===============
Distribution	Repository
==============  ===============
Centos		https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/YUM_Installation
Ubuntu		https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt
==============  ===============

On CentOS 7 the default pgdata directory is ``/var/lib/pgsql/9.6/data``. The ``pg_hba.conf`` configuration is modified allowing for password authentication. On CentOS we need to exclude CentOS base and updates repo for PostgreSQL, otherwise dependencies might resolve to the postgresql supplied by the base repository.

On Ubuntu default pgdata directory is ``/var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main``, while the configuration files are stored in ``/etc/postgresql/9.6/main``. There's no need to modify the HBA configuration file since, by default, it is allowing password authentication.

PostgreSQL start/stop/status in entrusted to Systemd on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu Xenial.

==============	=================
Distribution	Command
==============  =================
CentOS 7	sudo systemctl start/stop/status postgres-9.6
Ubuntu Xenial	sudo systemctl start/stop/status postgresql
==============  =================

Galaxy database configuration
*****************************

Two different database are configured to track data and tool shed install data, e.g. allowing to bootstrap fresh Galaxy instance with pretested installs.
The database passwords are randomly generated and the passoword can be retrieved in the ``galaxy.yml`` file.
 
Galaxy database is named ``galaxy`` and is configured in the ``galaxy.yml`` file:

::

  database_connection = postgresql://galaxy:gtLxNnH7DpISmI5FXeeI@localhost:5432/galaxy


The shed install tool database is named ``galaxy_tools`` and is configured as:

::

  install_database_connection = postgresql://galaxy:gtLxNnH7DpISmI5FXeeI@localhost:5432/galaxy_tools

PostgresSQL troubleshooting
***************************

With the recents update (October 2019) the package python2-psycopg2 requires postgresql12-libs, resulting in a broken environment since the package is not available.
We avoid this behaviour excluding python pytho2-psycopg2 update in ``/etc/yum.conf`` file with the line ``exclude=python2-psycopg2``.
If you need to update it, just remove it from the exclude line in ``/etc/yum.conf``.

Docker configuration
********************

On Docker container PostgreSQL cannot be managed through systemd/upstart, since there's no init system on CentOS and Ubuntu docker images.
Therefore, the system is automatically configured to run postgresql using ``supervisord``.

NGINX
-----

To improve Galaxy performance, NGINX is used as web server. The official Galaxy nginx packages are used by default (built in upload module support).

==============  ===============
Distribution    Repository
==============  ===============
Centos          https://depot.galaxyproject.org/yum/
Ubuntu          ppa:galaxyproject/nginx
==============  ===============

Moreover, on Ubuntu, we need to prevent NGINX to be updated by apt default packages. For this purpose the pin priority of NGINX ppa packages is raised, by editing ``/etc/apt/preferences.d/galaxyproject-nginx-pin-700`` (more on apt pinning at: https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences).

NGINX is configured following the official Galaxy wiki: https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/nginx-proxy/.

NGINX is started, usually using systemd:

::

  $ sudo systemctl start nginx

NGINX options
*************
NGINX options are listed here: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/commandline/

To start/stop/status NGINX with systemd:

==============  =================
Dstribution     Command
==============  =================
CentOS 7        sudo systemctl start/stop/status nginx
Ubuntu Xenial   sudo systemctl start/stop/status nginx
==============  =================

NGINX troubleshooting
*********************

Running NGINX on CentOS through systemd could lead to this error in ``/var/log/nginx/error.log``, which can prevent Galaxy web page loading:

::

  2017/08/24 08:22:32 [crit] 3320#0: *7 connect() to 127.0.0.1:4001 failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream, client: 192.167.91.214, server: localhost, request: "GET /galaxy HTTP/1.1", upstream: "uwsgi://127.0.0.1:4001", host: "90.147.102.159"

This is related to SELinux policy on CentOS.

.. Warning::

   You should avoid to modify SELinux policy, since you can still use NGINX command line options.

Anyway, the problem is that selinux dany socket access. This results in a generic access denied error in NGINX's log, the important messages are actually in selinux's audit log. To solve this issue, you can ran the following commands as superuser.

::

  # show the new rules to be generated
  grep nginx /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow

  # show the full rules to be applied
  grep nginx /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -m nginx

  # generate the rules to be applied
  grep nginx /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M nginx

  # apply the rules
  semodule -i nginx.pp

Then restart NGINX.

You may need to generate the rules multiple times (likely four times to fix all policies), trying to access the site after each pass, since the first selinux error might not be the only one that can be generated.

uWSGI
-----

uWSGI (https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest) is used as interface between the web server (i.e. NGINX) and the web application (i.e. Galaxy). Using uWSGI for production servers is recommended by the Galaxy team: https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/performance/scaling/

uWSGI configuration is embedded in the galaxy.yml file (``$HOME/galaxy/config/galaxy.yml``), and by default foresee 4 handler configuration.
The number of processes (i.e. uWSGI workers is set to ``number_of_virtual_cpus - 1``). This configuration should be fine for most uses. Nevertheless, there's no golden rule to define the workers number. It is up to the end-user to configure it dependig on your needs. The same goes for the number of job handlers (4 by default).

uWSGI socket and stats server are, by default, listening on ``127.0.0.1:4001`` and ``127.0.0.1:9191``, respectively. More on the uWSGI stats server here: http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StatsServer.html?highlight=stats%20server.

:: 
  enable-threads: true
  socket: 127.0.0.1:4001
  manage-script-name: True
  stats: 127.0.0.1:9191
  logto: /var/log/galaxy/uwsgi.log
  no-orphans: true

Proftpd
-------
To allow user to upload files (> 2GB) through FTP, Proftpd is installed and configured on each Galaxy server, according to: https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/upload-via-ftp/

Proftpd configuration file is located at ``/etc/proftdp.conf`` on CentOS and ``/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf`` on Ubuntu.

To grant a user access to read emails and passwords from the Galaxy database, a separate user is created for the FTP server which has permission to SELECT from the galaxy_user table and nothing else.

Proftpd is listening on port ``21``. FTP protocol is not encrypted by default, thus any usernames and passwords are sent over clear text to Galaxy.

How to use FTP through FileZilla
********************************

Open FileZilla and configure it with:

#. Host: Galaxy ip address (e.g. 90.147.170.108), without the ``/gaaxy``.

#. User name: your e-mail address on Galaxy.

#. Password: your password on Galaxy.

#. Port: 21

.. figure:: img/ftp_filezilla.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center


How to use FTP through command line
***********************************
To install FTP command line client, type ``sudo yum install ftp`` on CentOS or ``sudo apt-get install ftp`` on Ubuntu.

To establish a connection with Glaxy Proftpd server, you can use your Galaxy username and password, in addition to the server IP address you’re connecting to (e.g. ``90.147.102.82``). To open a connection in Terminal type the following command, replacing the IP address with your server IP address:

::

  $ ftp 90.147.102.82
  Connected to 90.147.102.82.
  220 ProFTPD 1.3.5e Server (galaxy ftp server) [::ffff:90.147.102.82]
  Name (90.147.102.82:marco): 

Then login with your Galaxy credentials, typing your Galaxy e-mail address and password:

::

  $ ftp 90.147.102.82
  Connected to 90.147.102.82.
  220 ProFTPD 1.3.5e Server (galaxy ftp server) [::ffff:90.147.102.82]
  Name (90.147.102.82:marco): ma.tangaro@gmail.com
  331 Password required for ma.tangaro@gmail.com
  Password: 

To upload file to your Galaxy remote directory:

::

  ftp> put Sc_IP.fastq 
  local: Sc_IP.fastq remote: Sc_IP.fastq
  229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||30023|)
  150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for Sc_IP.fastq
  8% |******                                                                           | 12544 KiB   23.84 KiB/s  1:31:23 ETA

Then you will find it on Galaxy:

Here’s a list of the basic commands that you can use with the FTP client.

============  ======================
Command       Description
============  ======================
ls	      to find out the pathname of the current directory on the remote machine.
cd            to change directory on the remote machine.
pwd           to find out the pathname of the current directory on the remote machine.
delete        to delete (remove) a file in the current remote directory (same as rm in UNIX).
mkdir         to make a new directory within the current remote directory.
rmdir         to remove (delete) a directory in the current remote directory.
get           to copy one file from the remote machine to the local machine
|             ``get ABC DEF``  copies file ABC in the current remote directory to (or on top of) a file named DEF in your current local directory.
|             ``get ABC``      copies file ABC in the current remote directory to (or on top of) a file with the same name, ABC, in your current local directory. 
mget          to copy multiple files from the remote machine to the local machine; you are prompted for a y/n answer before transferring each file.
put           to copy one file from the local machine to the remote machine.
mput          to copy multiple files from the local machine to the remote machine; you are prompted for a y/n answer before transferring each file.
quit          to exit the FTP environment (same as bye).
============  ======================

Supervisord
-----------
Supervisor is a process manager written in Python, which allows its users to monitor and control processes on UNIX-like operating systems.
It includes: 

#. | Supervisord daemon (privileged or unprivileged);
#. | Supervisorctl command line interface;
#. | INI config format;
#. | [program:x] defines a program to control.

Supervisord requires root privileges to run.

Galaxy supervisord configuration is located `here <https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/framework_dependencies.html?highlight=uwsgi#supervisor>`_ and `here <https://galaxyproject.github.io/dagobah-training/2016-saltlakecity/002a-systemd-supervisor/systemd-supervisor.html#1>`_.

A configuration running the Galaxy server under uWSGI has been installed on ``/etc/supervisord.d/galaxy_web.ini`` on CentOS, while it is located on ``/etc/supervisor/conf.d/galaxy.conf`` on Ubuntu.
The options  ``stopasgroup = true`` and ``killasgroup = true`` ensure that the ``SIGINT`` signal, to shutdown Galaxy, is propagated to all uWSGI child processes (i.e. to all uWSGI workers).

PYTHONPATH is not specified in this configuration since it was conflicting with Conda.

Paths
-----

User data are automatically stored to the “/export” directory, where an external (standard block storage) volume is mounted.

All Galaxy job results are stored in this directory through galaxy.yml (galaxy.ini on galaxy < 18.01) configuration file. For instance, the files directory is located:

::

  # Dataset files are stored in this directory.
  file_path = /export/galaxy/database/files

while the job working directory is located:

::

  # Each job is given a unique empty directory as its current working directory.
  # This option defines in what parent directory those directories will be
  # created.
  job_working_directory = /export/job_work_dir

Here is the list of Galaxy database path directories:

::

  file_path = /export/galaxy/database/files
  job_working_directory = /export/job_work_dir
  new_file_path = /export/galaxy/database/tmp
  template_cache_path = /export/galaxy/database/compiled_templates
  citation_cache_data_dir = /export/galaxy/database/citations/data
